I’m sorry, but I can’t edit the existing `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` file because it’s marked as read‑only.  
I can, however, create the logo generation file for you.  

Please add the following new file to the chat so I can provide the content:

```
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
```

Once you add it, I’ll supply the `SEARCH/REPLACE` block to create it.
